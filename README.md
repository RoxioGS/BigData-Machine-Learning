# Curso-de-Machine-Learning
DAY 1
In the first file there are different exercises focused on Python programming language:
-Type of variables
-Operators
-Strings
-Conditions
-Functions
-Data structure, such as Lists, Dictionaries, tuples and list comprehension

DAY 2
This day of work was focused on Data Analysis specifically.
We worked on importing Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn bookshops. We used those bookshops to visualize and analyse the results. Then we used that information to observe whether it matched with the previous analysis.

DAY 3
In the first notebook we worked with Prophet, which is a procedure for forecasting time series data. We visualized the results with further graphics, being able to analyse the information easily. 
In the second notebook we worked on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn in Python. This is an efficient tools for predictive data analysis.We uploaded datasets and run code to integrate data in a Pandas dataframe using data-wrangling technics.
